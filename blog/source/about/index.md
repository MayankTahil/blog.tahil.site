# Introduction 

This blog originally started off as a weekend side project to learn more about front end development and to get my hands dirty with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS. After about a day, I realize just how easy modern tools have made it to quickly create beautiful, functioning websites. In a nutshell, this blog will serve to host content I've been originally stowing away in `README.MD` files within my GitHub repositories. Now I'd like legitimize them into online technical tutorials for the community to consume. However, this blog won't  focus *only* on technical 'how-to's' rather it will also be focusing on new and emerging technologies within the [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization) and [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) space. You can expect to see my personal opinions on start-ups and automation tools as they emerge into popularity. 

# Background

My education background is in Biochemistry with a focus on Neuro-engineering but professionally I work within IT as an experienced tech specialist who isn't afraid to automate anything and everything. I've been customer facing most of my career with marked experience in Pre-Sales, Customer Service, Networking, Cloud, Docker, and Automation. I consider myself a strong advocate of Open Source Software (OSS), Open Source Knowledge Sharing, and the ongoing shift of agile transformation at the data center and in the cloud. If I'm not working, you can likely find me walking my dog or exploring around the city. You can find out more about me by visiting my [online resume](http://mayank.tahil.site].
